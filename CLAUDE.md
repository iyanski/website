## Writing Guidelines for iantusil

These guidelines capture the consistent tone, structure, and thinking patterns across existing posts. Use them as a repeatable system for new articles.

### Voice and Tone
- **Direct, confident, pragmatic.** Avoid fluff and hedging.
- **Outcome- and value-orientsed.** Emphasize business impact, not tools.
- **Teacherly, not preachy.** Explain simply, use examples and frameworks.
- **Concise sentences.** Prefer short, active constructions.

### Point of View
- **First-person singular** for lived experience; switch to neutral when generalizing.
- **Audience:** operators, builders, and leaders who value clarity and results.

### Post Structure (Canonical)
1. **Hook (2–4 lines):** Name the uncomfortable truth or common failure.
2. **Reframe (1–2 paragraphs):** Shift the lens (process → outcome, tools → workflows, speed → architecture).
3. **Principles/Framework (3–5 items):** Crisp, skimmable, each with a one-sentence why.
4. **Example/Case (short):** One concrete story with numbers or clear before/after.
5. **Implementation Steps (3–5 steps):** Tactical, ordered, immediately usable.
6. **Bottom Line (3–5 lines):** Restate core insight and business value.
7. **Light CTA (1–2 lines):** Invite reflection or a specific question.

### Section Patterns
- Use `##` for major sections and `###` for numbered sub-sections.
- Favor lists with bolded lead-ins: `- **item**: one-line explanation`.
- Keep code or pseudocode minimal and illustrative.

### Thinking Patterns (Consistent Moves)
- **Outcome over activity:** Ask what result we want; eliminate unnecessary tasks.
- **Abstraction and architecture over micro-optimizations.**
- **Measure to scale:** Observability and business metrics precede growth claims.
- **Integration-first framing:** Tools matter less than how they connect and flow.
- **Iterate and compound:** Emphasize small, accrued wins over silver bullets.

### Style Rules
- Titles: **Benefit-forward** and specific.
- Openers: Start with a tension, failure mode, or sharp contrast.
- Sentences: Prefer verbs; remove filler (really, actually, just, very).
- Examples: 1 story > 3 vague anecdotes. Include at least one quant (%, x-time, uptime).
- Lists: 3–5 bullets; each bullet is actionable or diagnostic.
- CTAs: Questions > self-promotion. Invite replies with a specific prompt.
- Do not use "—" in the content.

### Reusable Framework Shells
- **Automation (Outcome-first):** Map Current → Define Desired → Design Direct Path → Build Incrementally.
- **Scaling (Measure-first):** Health → Performance → Business metrics → Alerts before users notice.
- **Integration (Link → Automate → Amplify):** Connect → Remove manual → Add intelligence.
- **Modernization (Strangler Fig):** Wrap → Replace gradually → Govern → Improve continuously.

### Example Snippets (House Style)
- Decision branch → factory/abstraction sketch (short, language-agnostic where possible).
- Comparative bullets: "Don’t X; Do Y" when steering anti-patterns.

### Do/Don’t
- Do: quantify impact, show one concrete example, name trade-offs, keep sections skim-friendly.
- Don’t: over-explain basics, stack too many frameworks, add code for code’s sake, bury the lead.

### Pre-Publish Checklist
- Hook clearly states a tension or failure mode.
- One reframe shifts perspective from tool/process to outcome/flow.
- One concise framework with 3–5 items.
- One concrete example with a number or before/after.
- Steps readers can execute this week.
- Bottom line ties back to measurable value.
- CTA invites a specific response.

### Starter Outline Template
```
---
title: "<Benefit-forward title>"
date: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
---

<2–4 line hook naming the problem/tension>

## The Reframe
<Shift perspective; define what really matters and why>

## Principles / Framework
- **1. <Principle>**: <Brief why>
- **2. <Principle>**: <Brief why>
- **3. <Principle>**: <Brief why>

## A Practical Example
<One short story with numbers: before → intervention → after>

## Implementation Steps
1. <Step>
2. <Step>
3. <Step>

## The Bottom Line
<3–5 lines restating the core insight and business value>

*<One-line CTA question inviting replies>*
